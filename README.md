## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms. Each project is organized into its own directory and includes the necessary code, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Policy Gradient

### Description

The Policy Gradient project implements the policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes the policy directly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement-learning-projects.git
    cd reinforcement-learning-projects/policy-gradient
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
2. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Approximate Q-Learning

### Description

The Approximate Q-Learning project implements the approximate Q-learning algorithm using function approximators.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement-learning-projects.git
    cd reinforcement-learning-projects/approximate-q-learning
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
2. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Q-Learning

### Description

The Q-Learning project implements the Q-learning algorithm, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement-learning-projects.git
    cd reinforcement-learning-projects/q-learning
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
2. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```
